A simple game made to be used with Google Cardboard

My game involves shooting balls at a target that moves backwards and forwards to get points. Though the features and gameplay are limited, I consider my application to be a game. There is a goal to work towards, that goal being to get the highest score you can. There is also some challenge involved (however slight) by having the target move. Additionally, the user is given some freedoms, by being able to choose when they can fire the balls.
